		KerbinSrfSplashed = No! Not the water!...
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The crew highly doubts the floating capabilities of this craft.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = You see a fish swimming by the window. It looks like you are under water.
		KerbinInSpace = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
		KerbinInSpace = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.
		KerbinInSpace = Planet Kerbin is so blue and there is nothing you can do.
		KerbinInSpace = You wonder at the fact that Kerbin is mostly green.
		KerbinInSpace = You stare out the window in deep thought, pondering the answer to the ultimate question, before being rudely interrupted by the Mission Control.
		KerbinInSpace = "Log: The alien planet seems remarkably similar to our own. Oh wait..."
		KerbinInSpace = Agoraphobia sets in...
		KerbinInSpace = Bound for the stars.
		KerbinInSpace = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your vehicle they had once held in place.
		KerbinInSpace = Your slide rule breaks, and you begin to search for your backup before realizing that you don't know how to use a slide rule anyway.
		KerbinInSpace = You're in space and not dead. The crew and Flight Control have agreed that it's indeed a big step forward.
		KerbinInSpace = You wonder if you will make it home safe.
		KerbinInSpace = You briefly contemplate your navel as you watch the planet pass below you.
		KerbinInSpace = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
		KerbinInSpace = Although the planet is indeed very round, you wonder if perhaps its roundness has been exaggerated.
		KerbinInSpace = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to microgravity. You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
		KerbinInSpace = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.
		KerbinInSpace = After rigorous testing, the crew has determined that microgravity increases the fun of bouncy balls by 200%.
		KerbinInSpace = You swear you saw a blue police box flashing away on a retrograde orbit.
		KerbinInSpace = It's very... round.
		KerbinInSpace = The planet appears to be round! It’s not flat like we thought!
		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in, from space!”
		KerbinInSpace = This is why we need fancy suits, huh?
		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in. We’ll get back to you… about to eat lunch.”
		KerbinInSpace = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there’s nothing to walk on.
		KerbinInSpace = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
		KerbinInSpace = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!
		KerbinInSpace = Let’s engage Warp Drive… wait, we don’t have Warp Drive?
		KerbinInSpace = Everything looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpace = “Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here.”
		KerbinInSpace = This is Major Kerman to ground control, I’m feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.
		KerbinInSpace = It’s time to leave the capsule... right?
		KerbinInSpace = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out -- maybe ankle-deep -- and the water seems inviting.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Are we there yet?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Hey, it looks like my globe!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "Hey, I can see Jeb's Ego from here!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "TO INFINITY, AND BEYOND!"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You feel dizzy, unable to keep your head from spinning. If you are going to build a larger crew pod, a web of ropes inside might be of help.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Planet Kerbin is blue and there is nothing I can do.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You reflect on the meaningful events it took you to get here, warmly recalling the moment you first decided to become an astronaut. It was just this morning.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You are chatting to mission control when your radio channel is interrupted by some guy named Major Tom frantically saying something has gone wrong. You tell him take a protein pill and put his helmet on.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You kill some time chatting with a random ham radio operator.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The command console reads "Welcome to space. Please enjoy your stay."
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The crew is reading books to pass the time.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky is mostly below us.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You are almost in an orbit with your home planet.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Maybe if you get out and push?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Just a little bit further to go!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Bail out!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Don’t bail out!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Do we have enough fuel to make it into real space?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = If you rotate the craft, we might end up aerobraking…
		KerbinInSpaceLow = As you gaze down on your home planet, you are simultaneously filled with wonder and amazed that you made it this far without exploding.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Here you are sitting in a tin can, far above the world.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = “Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”
		KerbinInSpaceLow = “Space? SPACE! SPAAACCCCCE!”		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The spacecraft's crew and some of the guys at Mission Control are playing chess over the radio.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You look out the window only to realize you forgot your keys at home.
