		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = You try to convince the graviolis that this is indeed an entirely new crater and not at all the same as the last one.
		MunInSpaceHighEastFarsideCrater = You wonder what sorts of questions this data will answer back at KSC. Other than "What is the gravity like above the Mun's East Farside Crater?"
