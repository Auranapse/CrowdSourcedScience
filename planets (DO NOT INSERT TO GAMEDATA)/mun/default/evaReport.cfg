		Mun = It looks like a really big rock.
		MunSrfLanded = You feel a peculiar quake. When you look behind you, there is a fresh meteor impacted where you were just walking.
		MunSrfLanded = There was something you were going to say, and even though you spent the entire trip over here perfecting your delivery, you've somehow managed to forget it.
		MunSrfLanded = You wonder how that rock got into your spacesuit.
		MunSrfLanded = It doesn't -taste- like it's made of dairy...
		MunSrfLanded = "Did I leave the keys in the ignition?"
		MunSrfLanded = You should have brought your golf club.
		MunSrfLanded = The dust is getting everywhere!
		MunSrfLanded = You confirm that the Mun is not made out of cheese. Mission Control is very sad.
		MunSrfLanded = That dust is getting into everything… Now stop staring and help me clean my visor!
		MunSrfLanded = You look up and search the sky for Kerbin. Suddenly, you feel very small.
		MunSrfLanded = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the situation is nominal.
		MunSrfLanded = You really want to jump again, but last time Mission Control yelled at you.
		MunSrfLanded = That’s one small step fo--the situation is nominal.
		MunSrfLanded = That’s one small step for a Kerbal, and one big cupboard of snacks for said Kerbal.
		MunSrfLanded = You notice some weird rocks in the distance.
		MunSrfLanded = You’re in a most peculiar way, and the stars look very different today.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = Yep, it's a crater all right. You've noted this down on your checklist with a smiley face. Science is fun!
		MunFlyingLow = Does it count as a mountain if it’s in space?
		MunFlyingLow = You're having a bit too much fun with the low gravity.
		MunFlyingLow = You try flapping your arms to go higher. After doing this, you try to perform a facepalm, but only manage a visor palm.
		MunFlyingHigh = Is this really a good idea? Staring at the cratered surface below, you're beginning to wonder...
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Feeling slightly bored, you play peek-a-boo with Kerbin over the crater edges.
		Mun = All you can think about is potatoes...
		MunSrfLandedPoles = You hum "You never make me be like you/I'm master of the moon."
		MunSrfLandedPoles = You are amazed at how mystifying the moon scenery looks like from the pole.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = You spot a narrow part of the canyon, and wonder if you could make the jump across.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = There are visible striations in the walls of the canyons.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = You hold your hand up against Kerbin, and use your thumb to blot out the sun. After thinking briefly about pale blue dots, the puniness of kerbalkind, and philosophy, you go back to wondering how sweet it would be to ramp off those dunes back there.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = As you step off your lander, saying the usual dramatic speech, Mission Control calls up, tells you to cut the chatter and to take the all-important surface sample.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = You look up and hope that the rocket scientists back on Kerbin did their math correctly.
		MunInSpaceLow = You Stare at the Mun amazed at how fast you are moving over the surface; maybe going out of the capsule was a bad decision.
		MunInSpaceLow = "I wonder if it tastes like cheese? Nah. Minmus though..."
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = As it turns out, there's no cheese!
