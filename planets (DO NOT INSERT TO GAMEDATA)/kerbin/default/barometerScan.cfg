		KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a fine day today.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Looks like a storm will arrive later. Version 0.25 maybe?
		KerbinFlyingLow = The pressure is lower here than it was at ground level.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = No storms fronts detected. Perfect day for a flight!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Mission Control checks the readings against the local weather report to calibrate the Barometer.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = No signs of adverse weather incoming, we can launch at any time.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = It's not going to rain for a long time.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Air pressure is slightly higher here due to the heat.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The barometer's analysis hints at unusually high humidity in the local atmosphere.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The Barometer reads low pressure. According to the weather station that means higher chance of rain later.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There's a storm coming, and its not your typical Kerbstorm.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The barometer appears to be frozen, or at least extremely steady.
