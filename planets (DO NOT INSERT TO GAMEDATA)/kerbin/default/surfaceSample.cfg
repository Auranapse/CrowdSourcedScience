		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You wonder why you put on a two-million-dollar space suit and got into a multi-billion dollar rocket just to pick up some dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Looks like dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Beautiful green grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Yep. Still dirt.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = This is some quality grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I didn’t sign up for this.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = An incredibly long, furry, purple creature slithers bizarrely out of the grass. You rub your eyes and when you look again there is nothing in sight.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = I got a jar o’ dirt! I got a jar o’ dirt!
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = You pick at the dirt and discover a worm under the grass. You promptly name him Kelbin and attempt to hug him but end up squishing him in your arms. You feel bad so you open up a container and gently place him inside.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Dirt, grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a groundbreaking discovery.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You discover dried out straw, lichens, and moss.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = You find a tiny fleck of a shiny yellow material among the rocks. It seems that there is gold in these hills.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The air is thin, the climate is frigid, and the ground is impenetrable.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you're in a climate-controlled suit, because it sure looks hot out there.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Sand, sand, and more sand. A rock adds some badly needed variety to the landscape.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You saw a blue box on the horizon, but it was just an illusion. Also, you picked up a stone.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = You remember your wilderness survival training… wait, do you need that training in space? What are you doing here in the desert? Someone is going to answer for this.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here is partially frozen and tufts of moose hair cover the matted grass.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's ice and snow, what a surprise!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The material appears to lower the surface temperature of whatever it comes in contact with.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the cracking sounds. You try to not think back on how you landed there.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You take a sample of the “ice.” Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. Is this what happens when water gets too cold?
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You pick up a small creature with far too many legs. Mission control denies your request to keep it as a pet.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You take a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You scoop up some watery sand and decide the best use for it is to build a sand castle.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Hey look, a wristwatch! Finders, keepers!
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = You build a sand castle, then take a sample of it. It’s sand.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The grass here is definitely not as green as it is in other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called “the Badlands” makes you feel cool.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Rock, coal, and dead plant matter make up the sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = You scoop up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample, you hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = "Dihydrogen monoxide, sodium chloride... wait, did you just send us a sample of salt water?"
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = There seems to be a lot of a liquid substance. Surely this will be a huge advancement in science as we know it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = This material seems to take on the shape of whatever container it is placed in. More study is needed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You seem to have captured a small crustacean. Mission Control is less than impressed.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Curious - something essential to life that isn't green, isn't explosive, and doesn't start with "K."
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You put the water into your pocket. It oozes and scroogles around for a bit. It gets in your nethers. Oops.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You find your pick and shovel rather ineffective here.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = You've taken a sample of the water. There are bits of vegetation in it, which strongly suggests there is land nearby.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Is that an engine bell?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = You attempt to pry off a sample, but Mission Control yells at you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Don’t we already know what this is made out of?
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You bend down to "gather samples," but decide to make some chalk drawings instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Getting a sample here will be tricky. Hey look, a penny!
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The sample is composed of some sort of grey rock, with one half of it nearly perfectly smooth.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Mission Control would like to remind you that, while we appreciate your efforts towards research, we already have a good understanding of the makeup of our runway.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. Could be a very good surface to land on.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = After examining the asphalt, you conclude that it would be a great place to cook an egg.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You're sure this area is pretty well studied, but you did find a nickle.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Dirt, dust, and burnt flecks of steel make up the sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Looks like… dirt. And rocks. And more dirt. Why are you out here again?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your metal detector beeps and whizzes a bit. After careful digging, you find part of the engine from Jeb’s pickup truck. How it got there you don’t know, but you do know why Jeb’s truck isn’t in the parking lot today.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You see small metal scraps from the latest rocket explosion scattered around the ground.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You pull off a loose bit of the grated metallic substance. As you stuff it in the sample bag, a couple engineers eye you angrily.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The grated area is metalic, and the concrete is very... concrete-like. The staff advise you not to remove any section of the well-engineered launchpad, because it is expensive.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Unable to sample the concrete, you pick up a quarter instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You find a small puddle of rocket fuel where the last rocket was. Oops...
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You attempt to dig up a sample before you realizing that you are trying to dig up concrete with a shovel. You play it cool and hope no one notices.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You find the remains of an engine.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Your shovel hits the ground and... nothing. SCIENCE!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You pick up a small screw that seems to have fallen out of your rocket. You hope it's not important.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = You notice that someone may have planted onions here once.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Years of training has brought kerbalkind here, to find this handful of soil! You hope you won't be fired for that.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The substance contains a remarkable amount of organic material. Excited, you inform Mission Control of this fact, but they seem less than thrilled.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You try to taste the ground, but realize that that would be silly. You kiss it instead, happy to be here alive, for once.
