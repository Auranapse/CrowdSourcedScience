		MunSrfLanded = The thermometer can’t seem to make up its mind whether it’s hot or cold here.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = It's pretty cold here. You'd almost think Kerbol hadn't shined here crater since it was formed!
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = The thermometer is shivering from the cold. With the high walls blocking all the sunlight, this is not surprising.
		MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The blackened rocks absorb and radiate large quantities of the Sun's heat. You briefly consider the idea of sunbathing, but realize you don't have a beach towel. Oh well...
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The long shadows cast by the crater rims make this region colder than the surrounding highlands.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The surface here seems to reflect much of the Sun's heat. As a result, it is slightly cooler here.
