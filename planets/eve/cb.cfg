		EveSrfLandedCraterLake = When the materials bay was opened, most of the samples fell out. Some of them floated, and others sank. Fascinating!
		EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = The materials look happy as they quickly dissolve in the mix of chemicals that make up this sea.
		EveSrfLandedMountains = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.
