		MunInSpace = The instrument surveys for changes in the field of the Mun. This data will help to accurately calculate the mass of the body.
		MunSrfLanded = The sensor conducts a detailed survey of the local gravity.
		MunSrfLanded = After calibration, the sensor is able to detect the interplay of gravity between Kerbin and the Mun.
