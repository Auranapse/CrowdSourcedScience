		MinmusSrfLanded = You detect somewhat violent shuddering somewhere on the opposite side of Minmus. It was likely caused by a small meteorite impact.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You watch the data as it clearly shows that nothing interesting is happening at all.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The lake beds rumble periodically. Perhaps the tidal forces are causing heating under all that ice.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The vibrations indicate there's some rock under all that ice.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You detect some seismic activity, most likely caused by tidal forces.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Faint seismic waves are detected.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Sounds of shifting and vibration are detected under the surface. It is possible that the interior is not completely frozen.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The seismometer detects some minor quakes, and what sounds like bubbling. Perhaps these areas are resurfaced by occasional geological activity.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = A large impact nearby sends shockwaves throughout the planet. This is a perfect opportunity to map the interior!
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = A boulder rolling down the neighboring slope interferes with your readings.
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = There's a lot of static on the sensor feed. Are we sliding down the hill?
