		KerbinInSpace = The sensor finds subtle changes in Kerbin’s gravitational field. The science team will want to see these readings!
		KerbinInSpace = The gravity seems to be incredibly high for a celestial body of this size. It must be composed of an extremely dense material.
		KerbinSrfLanded = The sensor seems to think it's being calibrated.
		KerbinSrfLanded = After reading the manual a few times, the command team is able to take an accurate reading of the local gravity.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = For some reason, the planet seems to be pulling you in. What a surprise!
