		KerbinSrfLanded = The materials show little signs of change, though one of the samples appears to be judging you slightly.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The less resilient samples appear to have splattered around the interior, forming new and interesting color combinations.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The rarified air has caused interesting changes to the gel samples. It seems like something is happening with the interior structure.
		KerbinInSpace = As you open the bay doors, a sample floats out, heavily convulsing and making high pitched noises via radio. Command denies your request to kill it with fire.
		KerbinInSpace = A frozen glowing squid has just floated out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You see a rubber duck float out of the Material Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The microgravity has greatly affected the growth of crystalline structures. Loose objects are also flying around the bay in a very messy but fascinating way.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples begin to float out of the main chamber. You manage to close the doors, but not before losing a few to the endless void. You wonder how the lab techs will feel about this.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gel samples shrink, boil and freeze simultaneously when exposed to the hard vacuum of space.
