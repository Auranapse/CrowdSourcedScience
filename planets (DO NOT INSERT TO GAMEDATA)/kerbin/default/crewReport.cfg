		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Just a heads’ up: We're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of the flight. Honestly, we're throwing science at the wall here. Best case scenario, you gain some superpowers. Worst case, you get commemorated.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Are we there yet?

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Check ignition and may Von Kerman’s love be with you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You wonder what that nasty smell is. Either there is a serious propellant leak or Bob had burritos for lunch. Again.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You examine the blinking lights and stare intensely at the fuel gauges. Looks like we are ready to go.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You furtively pull out the corned beef sandwich you smuggled on board and take a bite. Some crumbs drop into the flight controls, but no worries - they should float right back out once you’re in space.

		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = There can be only one report from the Highlands!
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = It’s pretty boring out here. This must be why there aren’t many cities on Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = You calculate the chance of impact at this altitude. It does not make you feel safe.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Okay, just hallucinating.
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The mountains rise up from the grasslands of Kerbin. They seem so much smaller from up here.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You look out the window hoping to find a tasty cake until you realize somebody made a slight spelling error in the flight plan.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.

		KerbinInSpace = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
		KerbinInSpace = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.

		KerbinInSpace = Agoraphobia sets in...
		KerbinInSpace = Bound for the stars.
		KerbinInSpace = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your vehicle they had once held in place.

		KerbinInSpace = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there’s nothing to walk on.
		KerbinInSpace = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.

		KerbinInSpace = It’s time to leave the capsule... right?
