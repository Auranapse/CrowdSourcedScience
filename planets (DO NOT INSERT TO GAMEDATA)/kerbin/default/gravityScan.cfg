		KerbinInSpace = The sensor finds subtle changes in Kerbin’s gravitational field. The science team will want to see these readings!
		KerbinInSpace = The gravity seems to be incredibly high for a celestial body of this size. It must be composed of an extremely dense material.
		KerbinSrfLanded = The sensor seems to think it's being calibrated.
		KerbinSrfLanded = After reading the manual a few times, the command team is able to take an accurate reading of the local gravity.
		KerbinInSpaceGrasslands = The instrument surveys the gravity over the grasslands. It appears the field is very stable here.
		KerbinInSpaceHighlands = The instrument surveys the highlands of Kerbin. The rolling hills seem to affect local gravity slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceMountains = The gravitational field is rather strong in these mountain ranges.
		KerbinInSpaceDeserts = The dunes appear to have a stable gravity, though some spikes indicate the underground terrain varies in composition.
		KerbinInSpaceBadlands = The sensor gives a very negative readout as you pass over the badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceIceCaps = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass underneath?
		KerbinInSpaceShores = The sensor passes over the shores of Kerbin. The readings appear to be nominal.
		KerbinInSpaceWater = The sensor shows a surprising variance as it passes over the oceans, hinting at what lies deep below the waters.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The sensor has detected changes in the local gravity that seem to be related to the passing of the Mun.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The scanner indicates that gravity does, in fact, exist.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = For some reason, the planet seems to be pulling you in. What a surprise!
