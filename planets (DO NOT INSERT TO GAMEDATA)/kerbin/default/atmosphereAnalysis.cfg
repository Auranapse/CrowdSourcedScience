		KerbinFlyingHigh = Make sure you're properly suited up if you plan on going outside.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Apparently, the atmosphere is made of ash and rocket fuel. But that might be because you're on the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = I think a fly just got in the research equipment... don't tell the scientists!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The extremely expensive array of sensors, samplers, and detectors has confirmed that today is a very good day to go to space. Which is nice, considering we already have the rocket out and everything.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The sensor detects an explosive atmosphere. Try getting off the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Wind speed changes slightly as a small insect passes in front of the sensor.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = A surprising amount of paint and ink volatiles, combined with ozone from welding and short circuits. About what you’d expect from a thriving space program.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The air here is very humid, and seems to have a bit of a fishy smell to it.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The air here is very humid. Water keeps splashing into the sensor, creating inaccuracies and sending sparks flying everywhere.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The humidity readings are off the charts! Open the hatch and check the sensor. Or not.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Sensors indicate a sudden decrease in ambient temperature and an increase in surrounding density.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You tap the sensor a few times, but it only spits sparks. Somebody should’ve told you it could only analyze air.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = There’s lots of gaseous nitrogen and methane here - clear evidence of both greenery and cows to eat it.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The analysis shows that it is often rainy and foggy here. There’s a faint trace of ethanol mixed with oak.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Not only is it cold up here, but the air is thin as well. The goat one peak over is shivering
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sensor complains about a mosquito divebombing it. Apparently it’s carrying mal aria.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the desert. The sensors are getting clogged up with dust.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = This would be a great place to work on your tan.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The sensors report that the air is cold but otherwise nominal.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The polar atmosphere is very, very cold indeed. Some of the sensors have frozen shut, but we're reasonably sure this is still air.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It’s a tiny bit nippy here.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = You find that the air is much dryer over the desert.
