	{
		MinmusSrfLanded = The ground seems to reflect most of the Sun's thermal energy, yet the ground temperature is much higher than it should be. This warrants further investigation.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you suspected, it's very cold here.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The temperature is just cold enough for a good ice cream cone.
		MinmusSrfLandedFlats = The thermometer suddenly reads NaN. One of the wires must have come loose again.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The temperature reading suggests that this area might be made of ice cream. Acquiring a surface sample is highly recommended.
		MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = Temperature reads "Minty Fresh." You make an addendum requesting that all future thermometers use numbers instead of wisecracks.
