		MunFlyingLow = Just for kicks you measure the pressure here. Yep, no atmosphere.
		MunSrfLanded = The pressure gauge is sitting there motionless. Perhaps you should tap it a few times to be sure?
		MunSrfLanded = They say insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results. You check the gauge again. Still nothing.
		MunSrfLanded = The barometer shows zero. Somehow this hurts your feelings.
