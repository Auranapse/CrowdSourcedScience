		MinmusInSpace = As you pass overhead, the sensor does a sweep of the gravitational field.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The gravity readings dash your hopes - based on its size, Minmus is far too dense to be made of ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The readings confirm what you've suspected for some time - Minmus is a small moon with weak gravity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sensor takes detailed readings of the local gravity on Minmus.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The scan picks up the subtle changes in field caused by the orbit of the Mun. This data will provide valuable insight into the local system.
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The sensor is picking up a lateral gravity gradient... Oh wait, it's just the tilt of the slope. Why did we land here again?
		MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The sensor readings indicate that this would be an excellent location for a bouncy castle.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Sadly, the readings indicate that Minmus is far too dense to be composed of mint ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.
		MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.
