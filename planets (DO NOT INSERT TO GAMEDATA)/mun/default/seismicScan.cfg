		MunSrfLanded = Nothing to worry about. Really!
		MunSrfLanded = The sensor has detected a minor quake in the surface!
		MunSrfLanded = The sensor picks up distant impacts on the surface reflecting along the interior of the Mun.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = The Mün appears to be geologically dead. All you can detect are the slight tremors generated by meteorite impacts.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = The readings indicate a massive rockfall nearby.
		MunSrfLandedCanyons = The periodic moonquakes seem clear and easy to read here. The science team will want to see these numbers.
		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = The readings here are solid, but they might be better if we could do them in a canyon.
		MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The scans indicate a large series of quakes incoming! Oh wait, your hand brushed the sensor. False alarm.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = The ground appears to have many small fractures from the multiple impacts, causing slight distortions in readings.
		MunSrfLandedEastCrater = There's an odd signature coming from the crater to the west. You report it to Mission Control, hoping they'll be proud of you.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = The permanently shaded areas in the corners of the craters have slightly less seismic activity than the rest of the Mun.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = You wonder how long it would take an impact at the south pole to register at the north pole.
		MunSrfLandedNorthWestCrater = The massive impact appears to have created a fault line.
		MunSrfLandedSouthWestCrater = The quakes stop suddenly. You start to get alarmed, then realize you knocked the plug loose.
