		KerbinSrfLanded = Temperature readings are, quite literally, nominal.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The temperature reading spikes suddenly. Did somebody start the engines?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The temperature rises as an angry Gene Kerman comes over the radio and demands to know what you’re still doing there.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's hot here. That's not a reading, you learned it in primary school.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Large plumes of heat are rising from the surface of the desert.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The temperature here is very hot.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The thermometer quickly rises beyond the scale limit. You put it back into the shadows before it bursts.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold enough to freeze water solid… so why is there liquid water here?
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Just the right temperature to go for a swim.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The water here is warmer than in the open ocean, perhaps because there's less of it for the Sun to warm up.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Just the right temperature to be a lucrative shark mating area.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The water is colder than the surrounding air.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = It's cold enough to keep things permanently frozen here.
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The temperature here is quite pleasant. This would be a nice place to live.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature here appears to fluctuate depending on the time of day.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The temperature is bad, and it’s getting worse every minute.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The temperature is a little higher than you measured last time. Is it a measurement error or a sign of kerbal warming?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The temperature reading fluctuates wildly as the sensor moves in and out of the shadows.
