		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Is that an engine bell?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You attempt to pry off a sample, but Mission Control yells at you.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Don’t we already know what this is made out of?
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = You bend down to "gather samples," but decide to make some chalk drawings instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Getting a sample here will be tricky. Hey look, a penny!
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The sample is composed of some sort of grey rock, with one half of it nearly perfectly smooth.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Mission Control would like to remind you that, while we appreciate your efforts towards research, we already have a good understanding of the makeup of our runway.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. Could be a very good surface to land on.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = After examining the asphalt, you conclude that it would be a great place to cook an egg.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You're sure this area is pretty well studied, but you did find a nickle.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Dirt, dust, and burnt flecks of steel make up the sample.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Looks like… dirt. And rocks. And more dirt. Why are you out here again?
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Your metal detector beeps and whizzes a bit. After careful digging, you find part of the engine from Jeb’s pickup truck. How it got there you don’t know, but you do know why Jeb’s truck isn’t in the parking lot today.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = You see small metal scraps from the latest rocket explosion scattered around the ground.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You pull off a loose bit of the grated metallic substance. As you stuff it in the sample bag, a couple engineers eye you angrily.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The grated area is metalic, and the concrete is very... concrete-like. The staff advise you not to remove any section of the well-engineered launchpad, because it is expensive.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Unable to sample the concrete, you pick up a quarter instead.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You find a small puddle of rocket fuel where the last rocket was. Oops...
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You attempt to dig up a sample before you realizing that you are trying to dig up concrete with a shovel. You play it cool and hope no one notices.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You find the remains of an engine.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Your shovel hits the ground and... nothing. SCIENCE!
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You pick up a small screw that seems to have fallen out of your rocket. You hope it's not important.
