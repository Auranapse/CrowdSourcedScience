		Mun = After a brief analysis you conclude that the lack of data is very likely related to the local atmosphere's void-like composition.
		MunSrfLanded = You didn't even stop to think about the lack of atmosphere here before installing this sensor did you?
		MunSrfLanded = The analysis shows not even a trace of air. You decide to see how long you can hold your breath, just in case.
		MunSrfLanded = Instruments detect a faint particulate aura around the surface. Not an atmosphere, but it may explain the reported lights on the horizon.
		MunInSpaceLow = Despite what some say, the Mun does not feature an atmosphere.
