		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The atmosphere is slightly denser here due to the gasses escaping the ice beneath.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = Ice subliming off the polar cap raises the pressure very slightly.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = There's barely enough air here to fill a parachute, and don't even think of trying to breathe it.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The pressure is a little higher here on the valley floor.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Evaporating ice from the polar cap raises the pressure by a tiny fraction.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.

		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = It feels as though a stiff breeze is tugging at your ankles. You suspect that this means gas is escaping from the ice caps, and this makes you slightly nervous.

{
	%RESULTS
	{
		DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The Goo seems to have spattered about the container during the landing.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The strong winds from the surrounding mountains ripple the exposed goo.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = The goo rocks side to side, as though on a boat.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The goo seems to be very proud.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The Goo looks pink.
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The goo slowly rotates, catching what little dust is in the air this far north.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The goo staunchly avoids one side of the container. Did we pick the wrong pole?

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	%RESULTS
	{
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The seismic scan picks up some vibrations as gas vents from the ice cap underneath.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = The scan detects some activity, probably associated with melting of the polar cap.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	%RESULTS
	{
		DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The soil here is like tundra, dirt mixed with ice crystals, with a thin layer of fresh white frost on top.
		DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.
		DunaSrfLandedMaria = The ground here appears to be mostly basalt from ancient lava flows, with a thin coating of sand and dust.
		DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The floor of this depression seems to be composed of sedimentary rocks.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = You pick up some loose stones that look to have been part of a landslide.
		DunaSrfLandedMountains = You chip away at the hard basalt with your rock hammer and eventually get a good sample.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = You take a surface sample, hoping to determine if water was once flowing here.
		DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = Layers of darker sediment have been deposited here by long-dead streams and the constant wind.
		DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The valley floor is covered with layers of sediment laid down by the wind - and possibly water, long ago...
