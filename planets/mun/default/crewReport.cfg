		MunInSpace = You feel awestruck at the beaten up nature of the Mun.
		MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
		MunInSpace = You look back at Kerbin. I looks rather small.
		MunInSpace = “Crew reporting in. We are currently near the Mun. It turns out it’s much bigger than we thought it was.”
		MunInSpace = You look at the surface of the Mun and try to find a good landing space. The inside of the craters might be the best option.
		MunInSpace = Wasn’t there an opera written about this once?
		MunInSpace = You don’t know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be… interesting.

		MunFlyingHigh = You wonder if you'll be able to order pizza from here.
		MunSrfLandedPoles = The crew cannot stop hyperventilating.

		MunSrfLandedCanyons = Seeing the dark canyon makes you wonder what wonders lie down there.
		MunInSpaceLow = You glance by your window at the surfa... Whoa! Who put mountains this high on a rock this small?!
