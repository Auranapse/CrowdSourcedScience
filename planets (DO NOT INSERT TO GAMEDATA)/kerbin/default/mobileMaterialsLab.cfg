	{
		KerbinSrfLanded = The materials show little signs of change, though one of the samples appears to be judging you slightly.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = You think that this experiment is rather superfluous.
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The materials are neatly arranged, waiting for launch. You suppress the urge to shake the container.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The materials are all facing upwards. You hastily turn them sideways.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The samples look like pretty much everything else around here.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The materials all seem to be posing, preparing for the scientists’ examination.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated the samples. You learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Some samples are very brittle, while others have made a fire to warm themselves.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has been… enlightening.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry what it will do to them.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The less resilient samples appear to have splattered around the interior, forming new and interesting color combinations.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The rarified air has caused interesting changes to the gel samples. It seems like something is happening with the interior structure.
		KerbinInSpace = As you open the bay doors, a sample floats out, heavily convulsing and making high pitched noises via radio. Command denies your request to kill it with fire.
		KerbinInSpace = A frozen glowing squid has just floated out of the Materials Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You see a rubber duck float out of the Material Bay.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The microgravity has greatly affected the growth of crystalline structures. Loose objects are also flying around the bay in a very messy but fascinating way.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The samples begin to float out of the main chamber. You manage to close the doors, but not before losing a few to the endless void. You wonder how the lab techs will feel about this.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = Several of the samples have developed small fur-like projections.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The materials inside the lab start to mix in with the water. You suspect that might not be very safe.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The gel samples shrink, boil and freeze simultaneously when exposed to the hard vacuum of space.
