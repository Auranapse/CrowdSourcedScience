		MunSrfLandedHighlands = You take a small rock and your nine iron, place the rock on a T, and knock it into low orbit.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The Mun dust here is light and thin... It's very poor sandcastle-building material. That doesn't stop you from making one.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
