		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = It's ice and snow, what a surprise!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The material appears to lower the surface temperature of whatever it comes in contact with.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the cracking sounds. You try to not think back on how you landed there.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = You take a sample of the “ice.” Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. Is this what happens when water gets too cold?
