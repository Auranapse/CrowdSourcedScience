		Minmus = You try jumping into the air and strafing at the same time. Now, if only you had a water pistol...
		MinmusInSpace = Kerbin's smaller moon isn't as impressive as the other one. However, it does look much more yummy.
		MinmusInSpace = You wonder if it’s possible to EVA to the surface and back.
		MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
		MinmusInSpace = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
		MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface…
		MinmusInSpace = Well, it’s certainly much smaller in person.
		MinmusInSpace = Jetpacking down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
		MinmusInSpace = You look up at Kerbin and it looks smaller than ever. You think you can just about make out the Mun, too.
		MinmusInSpace = Kerbin looks small. The Mun looks small. Even the Sun looks small. You turn the binoculars the right way round.
		MinmusInSpace = Please let it be a sea of lime sherbert.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if Minmus tastes of mint, and if you could make a fortune selling tiny edible planets.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You watch Minmus' surface shimmer beneath and wonder if your tongue would stick to the ground upon a thorough licking.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Here we are. The giant mint in space.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You look out of the window and suddenly feel homesick.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Let’s go back, I saw a cool rock down there.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = I know there is no atmosphere, but it still feels stinky, like overripe cheese.
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = Don't fall over, don't fall over, don't fall over...
		MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = It's completely beyond your understanding why you decided to land here and not on the perfectly flat surface of the frozen lake below.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = You note that landing on a perfectly flat surface is somewhat boring.
		MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = You wonder why are you still sitting in your capsule while there's so much fun to have outside.
		MinmusSrfLandedMidlands = Low gravity and interesting terrain visible from the window invite you to come outside.
		MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The curvature of Minmus is easily visible from here.
		MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Well, it looks no different from here than it did from far away.
		MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The ground here is completely flat. It's really boring.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = You note that your radio fails to transmit when set to the OFF position.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = At this distance, Kerbin is little more than a pale blue dot, floating the the inky vastness of space.
		MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = "I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space."
